# WBAN Optimization

Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) consist of sensor nodes placed on or around the human body to monitor vital signs and other physiological data. This repository implements and compares energy consumption in WBANs using both non-genetic and genetic algorithms. In addition, it includes a simple interactive website showcasing the simulation results.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Energy Models**  
  - **Non-Genetic Algorithm**: Computes energy consumption per bit based on a fixed distance and power model.  
  - **Genetic Algorithm**: Evolves node positions to minimize total energy consumption.  

- **Data & Code**  
  - Python scripts for both approaches (see files at root).  
  - Sample dataset (`carbon_nanotubes.csv`) for testing GA convergence.  

- **Website**  
  - Interactive front-end to enter network parameters and visualize energy results.  
  - Located in the [`Website`](./Website) folder.
